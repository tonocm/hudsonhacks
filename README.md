Leftover
=====================

A HudsonHack product
---------------------

A webapp dedicated to sharing leftovers with the homeless.

###Process
1. Homeless person texts number with location (Street intersection *ex: 14th St & 3rd Ave*)
2. When food is available near you, you receive a text message with information of food & location
3. You meet up with them, and give food
4. When you move location, text the number with an update (*ex: UPDATE 23rd St & 5th Ave*)

Once a person submits their food, a text will go out to nearby homeless to alert
them that there is available food nearby, and a location to meet at within a certain
timeframe.

###What you need to provide:
* Name of food
* Servings
* Location
* Allergy information
* Timeframe

The homeless will receive all this information, except the location will be calculated to be a "safe" spot between the homeless and the provider.
